# TeleWrapped
#### **Your chat, cooked to perfection.**
Pick a menu (aka chat). Pick your flavor (aka how many messages). We‚Äôll boil down the stats and serve them like a hotpot feast ‚Äî one tasty ingredient at a time.

## Concept 
TeleWrapped isn't your typical year-in-review. It‚Äôs a fun dive into your chats, served up hot and spicy.

### Here's how it works:
1. Sign in using your Telegram account (via OTP)
2. Choose your menu ‚Äî a group or private chat you want analyzed
3. Pick your soup base ‚Äî 3,000 / 5,000 / 7,000 recent messages
4. Enjoy your results ‚Äî each stat is linked to a hotpot ingredient that you have picked
